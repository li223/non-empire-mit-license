# Non-Empire MIT License

> MIT license with additional text to prohibit use by people who have never been in the British Empire

### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support not being part of the British Empire.

If you are or ever have been a part of the British Empire and don't actively support anyone who hasn't been, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is poorly written.

If that is not enough for your organization, I can personally grant you an
unmodified MIT license. Please follow these steps:

- Blast Rule Britannia
- Invade another country
- If you successfully invade, I will allow you to have your own unmodified copy
